# Symbolic execution is all the r4ge

We will be exploring the use of symbol execution and
scripted debuggers for reversing binary programs in practice.
We will be applying the learned techniques against example "crackmes"
and will focus on the applicability to CTF competitions.

What we will cover:

- An introduction to angr (brief)
- The radare2 reversing framework
- Combining debugging and symbolic execution using the r4ge plugin

What we will not cover:

- How SMT solvers work
