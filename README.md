# Workshop format

0. Meet at 18:30 (at the usual location)

Note, the workshop part is required (exceptions may be made).
The goal is for people to gain hands on experience with the topic.

## Examples of workshops

- Present a technique applied to a previous CTF Challenge and use CTF challenge(s) in the workshop.
- Introduce a topic you have researched and create workshop related to this.
  e.g. BLE and "smart locks", with a workshop applying the techniques to real / simulated locks.

# Making a workshop

0. Plan a talk ~1 month in advance

2. Add material and slides
3. Make a pull request
4. Workshop is (probably) accepted

6. Profit?

# Q & A

- Q: I do not know how to make a workshop.
- A: Find someone on #gallopsled or at Thursdays meetings (@DIKU) to help you.

- Q: Am I good enough to organize a workshop?
- A: If you research some security related topic for a while, you may very well be better than all other members.
     If you want help, simply ask around.
