# Workshop format

0. Meet at 18:30 (at the usual location)

Note, the workshop part is required (exceptions may be made).
The goal is for people to gain hands on experience with the topic.

## Examples of workshops

- Introduce a topic you have researched and create workshop related to this.
  e.g. BLE and "smart locks", with a workshop applying the techniques to real / simulated locks.

# Q & A

- Q: I do not know how to make a workshop.
- A: Find someone on #gallopsled or at Thursdays meetings (@DIKU) to help you.

- Q: Am I good enough to organize a workshop?
- A: If you research some security related topic for a while, you may very well be better than all other members.
     If you want help, simply ask around.
